# cli-automation
This is a bash script to automate the process of creating a VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway, Route Table and Security Group and attaching them to a pre-configured EC2 instance from a specific region. For this to work, you will need to have setup aws-configure beforehand. Just run the script and it should work.
